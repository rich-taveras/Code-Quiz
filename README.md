# Code-Quiz

## Description

The Code Quiz Challenge is an interactive web application that tests your coding knowledge in a fun and engaging way. Put your coding skills to the test by answering a series of questions covering various coding topics, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each question is timed, adding an element of excitement and urgency to the quiz. Be careful, though, as incorrect answers will deduct time from your overall score. At the end of the quiz, you can save your initials and see your final score, which is based on the remaining time. Challenge yourself and see how well you fare in this thrilling coding quiz!
